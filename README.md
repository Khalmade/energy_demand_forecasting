# energy_demand_forecasting

The inability of the Nigerian government to properly forecast, plan and meet the national energy demand is one of the key reasons behind inadequate power supply in the country.
This project uses an energy dataset of the suppressed and unsuppressed national demand to develop a model capable of forecasting the daily energy demands of the country.
The goal is to create a basic model which accurately predicts the daily energy needs and use the data to create an energy system which can provide part of it for a smaller scale community needs.
